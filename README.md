# Dad generator using API

Initially, my plan was to use OpenAI API to prompt a dad joke and show the result. That made realize that ChatGPT for sure is not at dad yet as the jokes were not the best. Instead, I simply changed it to an API that pulls dad jokes and shows it from there.

This started as a simple idea for my team. There are several dads or dads to be and we like to joke around. This includes all the non dads as well. Because I want to practice backend and API calls, I decided to create a (dad)joke generator to use OpenAI API to prompt the joke and display it. This is also to test using React because I think it's cooler than building website the old conventional way.
